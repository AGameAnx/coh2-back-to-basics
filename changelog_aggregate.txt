## v1.0
=================================================================

Note: All damage, range, accuracy and area of effect values in army change details are presented after the global changes to the weapons listed in the general changes column

-----------------------------------------------------------------
## Attributes:

General:
- Antiblob added to all infantry. Infantry in close proximity to each other (within 7 ingame units) will receive a stacking 10% accuracy penalties. Look for the status icon
- Max range of small arms weapons increased by 12.5%
- All small arms damage increased by 55.25%
- Modified small arms default range tables:
 * Far increased by 12.5%
 * Medium increased by 5%
 * Near increased by 5%
- Modified small arms default accuracy tables:
 * Far decreased by 46%
 * Mid decreased by 15.85%
 * Near increased by 35%
- Reduced the effectiveness of small arms against light cover by 15%
- Redone area effect for all weapons
 * Max radius damage decreased by 30%
 * Max radius increased by 35%
 * Far radius increased by 35%
 * Mid radius decreased by 10%
 * Near radius decreased by 35%
- All small arms arcs of fire increased:
 * Arc of fire 180 -> 270 (-90/90 -> -135/135)
 * Maneuvering in battle is less punishing than previously
 * Most LMGs retain their smaller 140-180 degree arcs
 * Grenadiers had a 120 degree arc previously, therefore their new arc is only 180
- Increased all tank and antitank ranges by 10%
- Tank and antitank weapon distance profile doesn't fall off linearly anymore, mid range falls off faster
- Slightly increases tank accuracy on all ranges
- All vehicles now have fuel upkeep based on their initial fuel and population costs (fuelCost / 650 * math.max(1, pop*1.35-4) per minute)
- All tank and anti-tank weapons will now take longer to aim with range
 * AT weaponry 1 (0.125s) / 1 (0.125s) / 1 (0.125s) -> 1 (0.125s) / 3 (0.375s) / 7 (0.875s)
 * Tank weaponry 1 (0.125s) / 1 (0.125s) / 1 (0.125s) -> 1 (0.125s) / 5 (0.625s) / 12 (1.5s)
- HMG global rework:
 * Received accuracy debuff reduced from 25% to 15%. This debuff is not required with the new damage model. Flanking an MG still means it needs to retreat but killing the gunner from the front will not be as easy. Mortars retain this debuff
 * Damage increases across the board. This is done due to the fact that engagements happen faster in the mod and suppression is not quite as valuable
 * Suppression circle radii increased
 * Max tracking angles (arcs of fire) reduced
 * Reduced damage output effectiveness vs suppressed units (0.5 -> 0.35)
 * Further details in faction change lists
- Infantry make casualty critical is disabled for the time being. This is done to resolve the issue of crawling soldiers blocking pathing
- Flamethrower critical can now only happen when the squad is completely wiped
- Vehicle wreck smoke shot blocking and sight blocking effects heavily reduced (was causing unpredictable buggy behavior)
- Out of control critical should not happen to vehicles that have had a disable applied to them anymore
- Vehicle abandon critical rework:
 * Will destroy main gun and engine
 * Will restore 180hp to the vehicle
- SWS Halftrack, Kubelwagen, M20 utility car and M3 Halftrack wrecks are now destructible by small arms fire
- Global mines rework:
 * Slightly smaller lethal aoe range, resulting in fewer complete squad wipes
 * Will now apply a smaller overall amount of damage to infantry, but the same amount to vehicles
 * Aoe accuracy set to 5 on all ranges to prevent aoe from skipping dealing damage to entities on larger aoe distances
 * Max aoe range 6.3 -> 5.5
 * Far aoe range 3.1 -> 5.5
 * Mid aoe range 1.8 -> 3.5
 * Near aoe range 1 -> 2.15
 * Mid aoe damage 1 -> 0.35

 * Aoe medium range 5.625 -> 3
 * Aoe short range 3.75 -> 1.5
- Grenades now do more damage to garrison targets
- Global field artillery rework:
 * All field artillery now costs a certain amount of fuel, rather than a large amount of manpower
 * All field artillery received an increase in hitpoints. Counter artillery shouldn't ever destroy such an expensive stationary target in one go, neither should the stuka strike. The guns should still be heavily damaged
 * Most artillery shells received an AOE damage rework
 * Will also apply fuel upkeep to the player
 * Further details in faction change lists
- Global building panel health and weaponry aoe profile vs building rework. Tanks should punch holes through buildings more consistently but buildings should collapse slightly slower and in general more realistically (no more buildings collapsing from a single grenade)
- Increased the CP cost of most of the powerful offmap call-ins:
 * T34/85 10 -> 12
 * IS-2 11 -> 14
 * ISU-152 12 -> 14
 * Tiger Ace 15 -> 16
 * Tiger 11 -> 14
 * Elefant 12 -> 14
 * KV-1 8 -> 10
 * Command Panther 10 -> 12
 * Jagdtiger 13 -> 15
 * Panzer IV group 9 -> 10
- Due to the reduction of long range heavy tank damage their cost (and therefore their upkeep) have been reduced:
 * Soviet ISU152 cost 720mp/260f -> 600mp/230f, pop 25 -> 23
 * Ostheer Elefant cost 720/245f -> 650mp/245f, pop 25 -> 23
 * OKW Jagdtiger cost 800mp/290f -> 650mp/270f, pop 26 -> 23
- Due to high upkeep and initial cost heavy tank costs (and therefore their upkeep) have been slightly reduced:
 * Soviet IS-2 cost 640mp/230f -> 600mp/230f, pop 24 -> 22
 * Ostheer Tiger cost 640mp/230f -> 600mp/230f, pop 24 -> 22

Soviet:
- Tech tree rework:

 * Mechanized Armor Kampaneya cost 240mp/120f, 290s -> 240mp/135f, 290s
 * Tankoviy Battalion Command cost 240mp/120f, 290s -> 240mp/125f, 290s
 * Constructing Mechanized Armor Kampaneya or Tankoviy Battalion Command will reduce the 2nd building cost by 60 manpower and 45 fuel
 * T34/76 is now buildable from the Mechanized Armor Kampaneya
 * SU-76 is now buildable from Tankoviy Battalion Command
 * Swapped the names of Tankoviy Battalion Command and Mechanized Armor Kampaneya
 * Conscript AT grenade research cost decreased 125mp/25f -> 100mp/20f
 * Conscript Molotov grenade research cost decreased 125mp/25f -> 125mp/15f
 * HQ healing research cost changed 250mp/0f -> 185/15f
- Buildings no longer spawn a splat texture and are no longer revealed through fog of war

 * Base mine rework changes
 * Base damage 200 -> 100
 * Added 100 static damage that the mine will apply to vehicles it hits
 * Will no longer have a chance of causing heavy engine damage
- Conscript rework. Conscript spam should be less prevalent now (but not impossible). The aim is to make conscripts a great support unit but reduce their map presence potential and late game strength. Note that most Tier 1 units have received small buffs, but conscripts only get the cost decrease. You can flood them to the battlefield early and quickly and with support they will still perform, but they will start falling off in the lategame quite considerably, presenting a risk-reward dynamic to the mass conscript strategy. Details:
 * Base cost reduced (squad 240mp -> 220mp). This change is justified by the grenadier tier change and the fact that new damage and weapon ranges limits the usefulness of conscripts considerably (much harder to close in, harder to throw molotovs, bad scaling lategame)
 * Capture and revert rate multiplier 1 -> 0.9
 * Build time increased to mitigate the effects of lower cost in the early game 24s -> 30s
 * Vet3 Weapon cooldown 0.8 -> 0.85
 * Vet3 Received accuracy 0.77 -> 0.84
 * Sandbag wall health 500 -> 320
- Penal Battalion squad rework. The squad should assume a role of a much stronger base infantry effective on all ranges but excelling at none. Addition of light AT capability makes transitions when using Penal troops easier. Details:
 * Cost increased 270mp -> 290mp
 * Can now upgrade PTRS rifles for 70mu
 * Added a base 0.92 received accuracy modifier
 * Satchel Charge maximum area of effect range decreased 7.5 -> 7. This is done to mitigate the negative effects of the global aoe changes
 * Satchel Charge far area of effect range decreased 5.6 -> 5
 * Weapon effectiveness effectiveness increased considerably on long and mid range, reduced on near
 * Weapon mid range 16 -> 23
 * Weapon near range 6 -> 3

 * Near accuracy 0.68 -> 0.35
 * Removed burst pattern to improve visuals (used to shoot up in the air)
- SU-76 rework. This unit now provides a solid armor backbone, has potential to slowly kill infantry and dies slightly slower - a solid stepping stone towards reaching higher tech. Additionally, it has higher penetration but damage it does remains very low. Details:

- AI has 15% increased starting resources (to apply more pressure early in the game)
- AI has a slightly increased production rate
- AI has slightly reduced upkeep
