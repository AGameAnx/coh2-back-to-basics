=================================================================
## v0.31
=================================================================

-----------------------------------------------------------------
## Attributes:

General:
- New penetration system changes:
 * High penetration weapons can now deal additional damage to high health targets to speed up medium and heavy armor combat to approximately where it was prior to the implementation of the new penetration system
 * Projectiles with special effects on penetration (critical shot) are no longer a part of the system to make sure they work correctly
 * Fixed an issue where scatter weapon shots would never penetrate
 * Fixed an issue where modded projectiles would never penetrate
 * Fixed an issue where criticals would get applied to unintended entities
 * Ballistic weapons associated with the system can no longer daze the enemy (ISU-152, SU-85, Tiger, Elefant), this is removed because the chance to daze was possible even on penetration which means it happened too often
 * Changed the way range table is calculated for the new penetration system when ranges are -1
 * Added a 40% likelihood to cause a damage engine critical on 15%-0% health range, there is now a total of 60% likelihood that a tank will be disabled in some way when reaching this percentage of health

USF:
- Added 105mm Sherman projectile to the new penetration system

Soviet:
- KV-2 aoe improved:
 * Far aoe range 4.7 -> 6.3
 * Mid aoe range 2.3 -> 2.6
- B4 artillery rework:
 * Barrage rrecharge time reduced 130s -> 90s

=================================================================
## v0.30
=================================================================

-----------------------------------------------------------------
## Attributes:

General:
- A new penetration system has been introduced that considers side armor and angle of attack for all ballistic weapons. Noteworthy things:
 * Only tank and antitank weapons are affected (not artillery or explosive weapons), for a weapon to be included, it needs to have more or equal to 60 base damage
 * Affected weapon base weapon penetration reduced to 0.01 for script to work correctly
 * Affected weapons will now always penetrate targets that aren't vehicles
 * All of the weapon damage is now applied on the script side
 * Original armor values are used for every calculation. Side armor is calculated as an average between entity's original front and rear armor
 * The criticals are applied slightly differently, this is due to the fact that everything has to be done manually with scripting. The overall behavior should mimic the actual attribute criticals pretty closely
 * The experience is granted slightly differently. The amount of experience depends on the amount of damage dealt and target's max health and target's current veterancy level. The experience granted is doubled if the target is destroyed. The receiving squad's granted experience overall about 10 times smaller and is based on damage dealt, enemy squad max health and veterancy level. Overall experience granted is increased by 20% per veterancy level
 * Compared to vanilla, overall penetration chance can be increased by up to 43% on perfectly angled shots, and worst case angling results in a penetration chance that is still 3.5% bigger than vanilla. This is done to mitigate the balance impact of reduced damage per hit
 * The angle of the hit changes the outcome by up to 35% of base penetration likelihood and 45% of base damage (up to 40% reduction on frontal armor on worst angle, up to 30% reduction for side shots, up to 24% on rear shots)
 * The angle of the hit effect is reduced or negated when weapon penetration is higher than vehicle's armor, further increasing the importance of hitting rear and side armor and reducing or removing the importance of angling for light vehicles
 * Front and Rear are both hit at 45 degrees to each side (80 in total) from vehicle heading, making side armor be 100 degrees for each side
 * Rear armor kicker message removed
 * A new kicker message for each script-side penetrations added
- A new level of criticals have been added to all vehicles. At 15 to 0 percent health a vehicle may now receive destroyed engine and destroyed main gun criticals
- All non-lethal criticals removed 0 hitpoint critical level for vehicles, eliminating the last hit tank survival (vehicles reaching 0% health but taking crits instead of dying)
- Abandon critical likelihood reduced (5% -> 2%)

Soviets:
- SU-76 penetration reduced 130/160/170 -> 80/120/160
- SU-76 range reduced 63 -> 61
- KV-2 aoe profile reworked so that direct and indirect fire profiles match each other (overall less squad wipe potential)
- KV-2 damage decreased 240 -> 210

 * Effect radius increased 15 -> 18
 * Retreat chance reduced 10% -> 5%
 * Suppression reduced by 60% (1 -> 0.4)

- Elefant main weapon base damage reduced from 320 to 240 (same as the king tiger, jackson)
- Grenadier rifle grenade aoe profile redone (mid distance 1.6 -> 1.3, far distance 3.3 -> 3.8). Rifle grenades have had a high potential of instantly wiping team weapons from pretty safe distance. This change should make them slightly more reliable to do a lot of damage but not wipe as many entities in a squad

USF:
- 50cal machine gun base damage increased from 6 to 8
- Riflemen base received accuracy decreased from 0.97 to 0.92
- Increased 3rd level of veterancy requirement Lieutenant squad from 2560 to 2960
- Increased 3rd level of veterancy requirement Captain squad from 2880 to 3180
- Increased 3rd level of veterancy requirement Riflemen squad from 2240 to 2740
- Added additional 0.8 received accuracy multiplier on 3rd level of veterancy for riflemen, lieutenant and captain
- Pack howitzer auto-barrage range increased from 80 to 90 (still much shorter than barrage range)
- Pack howitzer entity target priority now set to -100, which will make other units target the crew before the howitzer itself. This is the default behavior for team weapons like mortars, OKW leIG 18 infantry support gun, AT weapons and other team weapons. The change should increase howitzer's survivability late game

OKW:
- Volksgrenadier accuracy on medium and far range increased (far 0.35 -> 0.4, mid 0.56 -> 0.59)
- Assault Pioneer entity cost reduced from 80mp to 75mp (squad 320mp -> 300mp)
- King tiger aoe profile redone to decrease squad wipe potential and increase reliability:
 * Medium range damage 0.35 -> 0.25
 * Far range distance 0.35 -> 0.45
- Jagdpanzer veterancy modifiers reduced:
 * Sight modifier on veterancy 2 set from 1.35 to 1.25
 * Reload multiplier 0.9 -> 0.95 on veterancy 3
 * Maximum speed 1.2 -> 1.1 on veterancy 3
 * Reload multiplier 0.75 -> 0.9 on veterancy 4
 * Accuracy 1.3 -> 1.15 on veterancy 4
- Jagdtiger main weapon base damage reduced from 320 to 240 (same as the king tiger, jackson)

## v0.2
=================================================================

-----------------------------------------------------------------
## Attributes:

General:
- All vehicles now have fuel upkeep based on their initial fuel and population costs
- Added a status icon for infantry affected by antiblob
- Reduced the antiblob penalty to 10%
- Reduced the antiblob radius from 10 to 7

Soviets:
- Tier 1 Barracks building fuel cost reduced from 50 to 40
- Slightly adjusted 120mm mortar aoe to make it be more lethal again after general aoe changes (far damage 0.05 -> 0.1)
- Conscript base cost reduced (40mp -> 35mp / squad 240mp -> 210mp). This change is justified by the grenadier tier change and the fact that new damage and weapon ranges limits the usefulness of conscripts considerably (much harder to close in, harder to throw molotovs, bad scaling lategame)
- Increased the effectiveness of Penal Battalion troop SVT rifle on long and medium ranges, slightly lowered their effectiveness up close. Thus change intends to make Penals a stronger base infantry and add an incentive to soviet T1 beyond snipers and scout cars. Since flame thrower effectiveness is generally reduced in the mod and snipers are generally much harder to keep alive this change should help provide a better backbone for positional soviet play
- Guards PTRS41 AT rifle damage increased from 40 to 60. This still doesn't 1 shot infantry, but should increase their effectiveness vs vehicles considerably
- Slightly increased Guards PTRS41 AT rifle close and mid range accuracy

- Reduced the effectiveness of mounted turret MGs
- Slightly nerfed PzIv and Stug-E aoe as they were overperforming after global aoe changes

- Walking Stuka cost reduced from 390mp 100f to 300mp 85f
- Reworked Walking Stuka damage and aoe to reduce its squad wipe potential significantly
- Normalized coaxial MG accuracy to Ostheer coaxial MGs (were twice as effective)
- Volksgrenadier veterancy accuracy modifiers heavily decreased
- Slightly decreased Flak HQ weapon range (50->47)
- Decreased initial Obersoldatten received accuracy modifier from 0.7 to 0.75
