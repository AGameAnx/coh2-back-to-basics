=================================================================
## v0.3
=================================================================

-----------------------------------------------------------------
## Attributes:

General:
- Antiblob no longer affects team weapons, vehicles and snipers

Soviets:
- Sniper team aim time increased from 1.125-1.75 to 1.6-1.9. This leaves the overall effectiveness of the unit only slightly decreased, but reduces its ability to kite away from chasing units while picking them off
- ISU152 health total reduced from 1040 to 850 to compensate for its overall strength, range and frontal armor
- Adjusted ISU152 aoe profile to make it deal damage in a larger area while having less squad wipe potential:
 * Far distance 5.6 -> 6.85 (aoe max radius is 7.5)
 * Medium distance 2.5 -> 2.0

Ostheer:
- Reduced base damage of Grenadier LMG42 from 6 to 5

- Elefant main weapon base damage reduced from 320 to 240 (same as the king tiger, jackson)
- Grenadier rifle grenade aoe profile redone (mid distance 1.6 -> 1.3, far distance 3.3 -> 3.8). Rifle grenades have had a high potential of instantly wiping team weapons from pretty safe distance. This change should make them slightly more reliable to do a lot of damage but not wipe as many entities in a squad

USF:
- 50cal machine gun base damage increased from 6 to 8

- Added additional 0.8 received accuracy multiplier on 3rd level of veterancy for riflemen, lieutenant and captain
- Pack howitzer auto-barrage range increased from 80 to 90 (still much shorter than barrage range)
- Pack howitzer entity target priority now set to -100, which will make other units target the crew before the howitzer itself. This is the default behavior for team weapons like mortars, OKW leIG 18 infantry support gun, AT weapons and other team weapons. The change should increase howitzer's survivability late game

## v0.2
=================================================================

-----------------------------------------------------------------
## Attributes:

General:
- All vehicles now have fuel upkeep based on their initial fuel and population costs
- Added a status icon for infantry affected by antiblob
- Reduced the antiblob penalty to 10%
- Reduced the antiblob radius from 10 to 7

Soviets:
- Tier 1 Barracks building fuel cost reduced from 50 to 40
- Slightly adjusted 120mm mortar aoe to make it be more lethal again after general aoe changes (far damage 0.05 -> 0.1)
- Conscript base cost reduced (40mp -> 35mp / squad 240mp -> 210mp). This change is justified by the grenadier tier change and the fact that new damage and weapon ranges limits the usefulness of conscripts considerably (much harder to close in, harder to throw molotovs, bad scaling lategame)
- Increased the effectiveness of Penal Battalion troop SVT rifle on long and medium ranges, slightly lowered their effectiveness up close. Thus change intends to make Penals a stronger base infantry and add an incentive to soviet T1 beyond snipers and scout cars. Since flame thrower effectiveness is generally reduced in the mod and snipers are generally much harder to keep alive this change should help provide a better backbone for positional soviet play
- Guards PTRS41 AT rifle damage increased from 40 to 60. This still doesn't 1 shot infantry, but should increase their effectiveness vs vehicles considerably
- Slightly increased Guards PTRS41 AT rifle close and mid range accuracy

- Reduced the effectiveness of mounted turret MGs
- Slightly nerfed PzIv and Stug-E aoe as they were overperforming after global aoe changes
